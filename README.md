# This is a chrome extension that informs people about common remote access scams when they load remote access websites. 

### the site is not blocked but information about how the scam works is displayed in pop ups that cannot be ignored.

I hope to make this extension to catch people at a key stage in the scam before the scammer has access to thier victims computer.

the scams have various stories but they usually follow the same flow:
1. The scammer claims to be tech support.
2. The scamer claims a refund is due and the victim belives they are owed money.
3. The scammer instructs the victim to log in to a remote acceess program
4. Once the scammer has control of the victims computer they instruct the customer to visit thier bank site
5. Once the scammer can see how much money the victim has the scammer knows how much money they can get from the victim.
6. The scammer pretends to initiate a refund, what they really do is alter the html on the website so it look like money has been deposited.
7. This is the scam. the scammer pretends to deposit too much money and asks for the extra balance to be sent back in gift cards, or sometimes cash.



I used to think that putting up a warning whereever giftcards are sold would prevent a lot of these refund scams from working, but the larger cash scams would be missed and no one is adding warnings to gift cards anyway.

Some companies have tried adding a warning to the site so the site can't be used for fraud, but by the time the victim is in view of these warnings the scammer already has control of the computer and hide the easily.

The idea is to inform potential victims how the refund scams work before the scammer is able to control the computer. At step 3.

So that's what this is. It's an educational pop up that is triggered when someone loads one of the popular remote viewing sites. it is meant to be installed by someone else to protect thier less tech-savy and more trusting loved ones.

Before your loved one downloads software to let someone else control thier compouter, they are briefly educated on red flags they are about the encounter and informed they are being scammed.
